# Novum
THis file is for ideas

- Each character can have a different color
- The computer can have 
- Mice plots with Try/Fail cycles. 

Using dialogue to simulate crises.
- Obscured text.
- People exclaiming.
- Sylistic typos. 

## Themes
- How do characters react when confronted with the unknown?
- Gods are created because we can build things that are more than the sum of their parts.
- Commentary on how we're taking computers to be godly.
- I want to lean into this deifying computers thing. 
Only computers are of the first order.
Computers have names of things that are traditionally associated with the divine but with numbers inserted.
4NGEL, 0RACLE, 
The first number indicates their order!!! Lower being better.
0RION, 5ERAFIM, 4RCHANGEL, 8ISHOP, 8EAST. 1EGEND,
5EER
1=I,L
2=Z
3=E
4=A
5=S
6=G or b
7=L
8=B
9=g or Q
Interaction between power and trust. The more powerful the computers become the less trustworthy they become. 

## Setting
- Could be the commander of a spaceship encountering some kind of Novum. 
- Could be underwater in a submarine type ship - On a different planet?
- What kind of medium do I want to explore. 
- Homeworld is Gaia for the human commander.
- Powerful Quantum Computers exist
- Warp Drives exist via quantum entanglement and Einstein-Rosen bridges.
- 

There's a Hierarchical structure based on terms in a series. Zeroth order and first order being the most powerful. 6th order and a derogatory term being perturbation.

## Characterization
- Formality, typos, slang. length of text. 
- Have one person be very short, but impactful.
- Sonar expert, Tactician, etc. 
- By the above I mean having crews with specialties. Each character should have their specialty known. 

### Crew:

#### Captain Isolde Rozen
Human who knew their parents.
- Mother was a priest who was imprisonned, enslaved, or otherwise taken away.
- Father was a criminal who abandoned us
- One of 7 siblings
Raised in squalid conditions with no permanent home.
Despite poverty was relatively popular.
Loves travel and exploring because no home.
Is a paladin in D&D terms. Like a religious warrior. Religion and Science have had a strange marriage now that space travel is a thing.
Isolde is 24 years old
Isolde is blameless for two distinct enemies she has.
Worked in 2 significant background (Outlander) related jobs.
The second one will be as a space poacher, but what before?
Smuggling and she yearned to be the one to go out and get the goods.

#### Blur (Ersnar Dr'Gnaboe)
- The technical expert on the team.

#### ORACLE
Quantum AI that belongs to Isolde.  

### Not in the crew:


#### Who is hiring the crew?
#### The AI of that person. 
Or are they just dealing with an android?

#### Rival of Isolde
#### Rival of Isolde



## Plot
Needs to be pushed by the Novum.
You play as a captain of space pirates/mercenaries/bounty hunters/archeologists.
There's going to be a macguffin. Potentially and ore. The crew gets hired to find it.
They get hired. The only ddecision in the opening will be to get a reward. 
- Have other characters express their fears and then as the captain you might have to send them to their death.  

### Plot things:
Pattern off of ethical dilemmas and off of rewards.
- A distress call
- Something unexpected on the Sonar
- A risky looking shortcut
- Inclement weather along the intended route at the cost of an unknown route.
- Find ruins of an acient civilization.

The ship they have to take has limited communications capabilities. 
If I really want to explore the ideas of both encounters with the unknown and God as computing I should have plots that reflect that.
Maybe the planet is actually a machine like the death star. Underwater. Has creatures. 

### Scenes
Opening scene:
The first decision you get to make is how your character behaves and what the crew chooses as it's reward.
Favour
Money
Cut of the Business
Technology

#### Dialogue
The crew speculates what the Zar is going to do with the ore.

## Structure
- Graph structure with articulation points. 
- Two acts. One full of No, Ands and Yes, Buts. Where your decisions. 
- Try/Fail structure. 
- The main plot will be an event story with idea and mileu substories.
- The end of the first act decides what capabilities, what people are alive and what tools are/aren't available.

The main  
<Event> Crew gets hired to do something
    <Idea> 
    <\Idea>

    <Milieu> Get off the planet alive
    <\Milieu> 
<\Event> 

A part where some of the team dies.
 
Yes, And, no but. Yes, But. No, and. 

Examines trust of computer 
exploration of the unknown.

## Mechanics:
The interface will be text in a terminal.

It will be of the form. 
**Name:** text that they say. 
and the system Dialogue will be slow-printed and the AI text will be slow-printed. 
Do people use aliases?

Dialogue slow-printed. 
Each person gets a colour. 
The player is going to get to choose between different options. What happens if they don't choose a valid option?
Just numbered options.
