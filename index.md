# About
I'm Benjamin Wong, a fourth-year Pure Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo. This is my Maker Project for the Winter 2023 offering of Science Fiction (ENGL 208B).
I've decided to make an interactive fiction story which explores individuals confronting the unknown and the relationship between humanity and technology. This medium is espescially fitting because the readers/players get to interact directly with a computer.

# Gameplay & Storytelling
Novum is an example of a medium called interactive fiction. Unlike a regular story, the reader plays an active role in the developement of the plot. 
In Novum, you play as the captain of a crew of space-poachers. Throughout the game you'll see dialogue scrolling as well as some images. Sometimes numbered quotes will appear. This is your opportunity to interact with the story. Simply type the number corresponding to the quote that you'd like your character to say and hit enter. 

# Instructions

1. Make sure that you have Python 3 installed on your computer. 
2. Download `novum.py` from [this git repo](https://github.com/benjaminwwong/novum). (Go into the terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/benjaminwwong/novum.git`)
3. Make sure that you have the climage library by running `pip install climage` or `pip3 install climage`.
4. Run `python novum.py` or `python3 novum.py` in a folder containing `novum.py`.
