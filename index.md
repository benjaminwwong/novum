# NOVUM
Welcome to the wonderful world of my ENGL 208B Maker Project

---

Right now there's nothing here, but at the deadline approaches in a few weeks the webstie will be polished a bit more.

- Build the rest of the site
- Flush out the rules
- Integrate the program
- Write the story
- Do a recorded zoom call play along with my friends

Which of these two links work to get to the other page?

[another1](/novum/another)

[another2](https://benjaminwwong.github.io/novum/another)


Is math supported? $$\int_0^5f(x)dx$$.
